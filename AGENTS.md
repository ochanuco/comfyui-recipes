# comfyui-recipes — agent brief

Read this before the first tool call. It is the stuff that is not in the code
and costs a session an hour to rediscover.

## What you are working on

The recipe and the worker behind chimera. `comfy-recipes` is the executor
that runs on the GPU box: `work` claims request rows from chimera, builds and
records a graph, submits it to ComfyUI, and ingests the result. Nothing renders
from this Mac. A session here drives rounds through chimera's MCP (see
"Renders reach the user through chimera") and edits the recipe in this repo.
**The defaults are the recipe** — every preset was arrived at by rendering, and
the exact prompt can be inspected with `get_catalog_pose` on the MCP or
`comfy-recipes <recipe> prompt` locally.

Three recipes are live, all under `src/comfyui_recipes/domain/`:

- `yukari/` — the original Illustrious recipe (hassaku-il-v22 through
  `DiffusersLoader`), `scripts/yukari_recipe.py` as its compatibility facade.
  `prompt_style.py` and `delivery_style.py` (the author identity),
  `costumes.py` (the wardrobe), `poses.py` (one record per pose),
  `recipe.py` (the interpreter that owns the assembly order), `models.py`
  (the `Pose`/`Edit` dataclasses). A new pose is one `POSES` entry plus one
  `POSE_RECORDS` entry in `poses.py`, nothing else. Its style block and
  texture bans are what the sketch recipe exists to remove.
- `yukari_anima/` — hassakuAnima_v13. Composition and proportion obey natural
  language here, but the picture reads as AI whatever the prompt does
  (`docs/render-notes.md`, the A/B rounds of 2026-09-05). Kept for its pose
  vocabulary; not the delivery path.
- `yukari_sketch/` — the current delivery path. hassaku-il-v22 with the
  linaqruf sketch LoRA on a minimal prompt (no style block, no texture bans,
  a moderate proportion block, simple grey background) and a latent-route
  2560 redraw at denoise 0.55. `docs/yukari/sketch.md` is the description;
  `poses.py` holds `cinema`, `stand`, `date`, `cafe`, `home` and `bath`. A
  pose is one `Pose` record (action string, costume, a `parent` pose it was
  derived from, and its face as `face_edits` diffed over the shared `FACE`
  block -- a full-string `face` override is still allowed as an escape
  hatch); `comfy-recipes sketch lineage` prints each pose's departures from
  its parent (or from `FACE`/an empty pose block, for one with none).

The ComfyUI node encoding for all three is under `infrastructure/comfyui/`.
`comfy-recipes {yukari,anima,sketch} prompt --pose …` prints what a recipe
sends.

Everything measured is recorded — see "Where information lives" below for
which store. The records are the point of the repository; the scripts are how
they were produced.

Run everything through `uv run` — the client env is pillow, numpy,
opencv-python and scipy, and nothing here imports torch.

## Where information lives (hard rule)

> Research logs are append-only. Code comments are current-state-only.

Four stores, one job each:

```text
src/          current recipe (What). Comments hold only the non-obvious
              constraints that guard today's values — a few lines per
              definition, no history.
experiments/  one observation per JSONL record (seed, render_id, parameter,
              value, outcome accepted|rejected|inconclusive, reason).
              Append-only: a refuted hypothesis gets a NEW record, the old
              one is never rewritten. Schema in experiments/README.md.
              An A/B round with arms and a chimera Batch is recorded as a
              chimera Experiment/Run instead of a JSONL record; plain
              observations still append here. The JSONL stays the source
              of truth; chimera holds a derived index kept in sync by
              `scripts/observation_sync.py`.
docs/         conclusions. Cross-pose lessons in docs/render-notes.md,
              per-pose reasoning in docs/poses/<character>/<pose>.md.
tests/        invariants that must hold across models and seeds (prompt
              byte-stability is already pinned by the snapshot contract).
```

Rules that follow from it — enforced by `tests/test_comment_discipline.py`,
which bans dates, render IDs, `1.45 -> 1.3` walk-downs, 「」 quotes and
comment blocks over 8 lines in `src/**`:

- A new failure is an `experiments/` record first, never a code comment. If
  the code needs anything, it is one short line stating the constraint that
  is now in force.
- New knowledge REPLACES a comment; it never stacks on top of one. If old
  and new disagree, the old line is deleted.
- Before changing a pose or tag, grep `experiments/` for the same
  character/pose/parameter. Do not repeat a rejected trial without stating
  what is different this time.
- An experiment result is an observation under its conditions (pose, prompt,
  checkpoint, seed), not a universal rule.
- chimera stays the per-render channel (every render is recorded there);
  `experiments/` is the greppable ledger the comments can point to.
- The `PENDING_CLEANUP` list in the discipline test names the files written
  before this rule; it may only shrink.

## Branch strategy: task branches

Work on a task branch; do not commit directly to protected branches.

Use `dev/<topic>` branches for implementation and merge only after review.

## Look things up; do not read them

Two files dominate this repository: `docs/render-notes.md` (~68k tokens) and
`src/comfyui_recipes/domain/yukari/poses.py` (~30k). Both are exactly what a
one-line question tempts you to open whole.
Opening any of them without a line range is a mistake, not a thorough approach.

For what a recipe sends and what chimera holds, ask the chimera MCP first — it
is registered in this session as `chimera` and answers without touching the
repo:

```text
list_generations                      find a starting ID: published=true is every delivered
                                      look, each carrying its look:<pose> tag
list_catalog                          every recipe's pose / costume names + patch/dial vocabulary (~2k)
get_catalog_pose recipe pose          one pose: canvas, default costume, assembled prompts    (~1k)
get_generation <short_id>             rating, semantic, batch prompt + parameters, seed
list_batch <short_id>                 every arm of a batch with rating and semantic summary
get_generation_lineage <short_id>     what it was derived or finalized from, and what came after
```

The catalog is what the worker published from its own checkout; it is the
production recipe, not this branch. For an uncommitted change, ask the code:

```bash
uv run scripts/atlas.py                    # every script: role, size, one line  (~1.5k)
uv run scripts/atlas.py notes              # the notes' headings + line numbers   (~2.8k)
uv run scripts/atlas.py notes <pattern>    # just the sections that match
uv run scripts/atlas.py find <regex>       # matching lines, each under its heading
uv run comfy-recipes sketch prompt --pose date                   # ~0.6k, not 30k
uv run comfy-recipes catalog                                     # what `work` would publish
uv run scripts/costume_check.py                                  # the blocks, verified
```

`atlas.py` reads the tree every time it runs, so unlike a committed index it
cannot be stale. Use it first; then `Read` with `offset`/`limit` on the lines it
gave you. If you find yourself about to read a file over ~5k tokens to answer
something narrow, there is probably a command or a tool for it — and if there
is not, adding one to `atlas.py` is cheaper than the read you were about to do.

`scripts/archive/` contains scripts that ran once and are kept as a record.
Nothing imports them and nothing maintains them; do not read them looking for
how something works today.

## Where the GPU is

**ComfyUI does not run on this Mac, and this Mac no longer talks to it.** The
GPU box runs ComfyUI and `comfy-recipes work`; chimera is the only thing a
session here submits to. `COMFYUI_HOST` / `COMFYUI_PORT` matter on the box and
for the low-level tools under `scripts/`, not for a round.

The box's address, the ssh alias for a shell on it, and the checkpoint in use
are in `CLAUDE.local.md`, which is not tracked. Read it; do not copy what it
says into anything this repo commits. `docs/remote.md` covers the box itself
(deploy, the logon tasks, restarting the worker); `scripts/comfy_host.py` is
the filesystem seam for the legacy tools — the worker's disk is not this one,
so outputs come back over `/view` and inputs go up through `/upload/image`.

## Renders reach the user through chimera; Discord is a side channel

The user reviews renders on chimera (https://chimera.chanu.co), not Discord.
A render that reached Discord but not chimera **is not delivered** — never
close out a prompt on the strength of a Discord post alone. Every render,
including one-off probes and chained passes, is a chimera request row that the
worker executes; that is the only execution path. POSTing to ComfyUI `/prompt`
directly is forbidden. A probe whose graph the recipe cannot build goes in a
`create_request` payload as `generation.graph`.

A round starts from a delivered look and is three MCP calls with a human in
between:

```text
list_generations      the base: `published=true` lists every delivered look
                      with its `look:<pose>` tag. This is where a starting ID
                      comes from -- never from a session's memory.
derive_request        from a rated generation: same recipe, parameters and
                      patches, plus your diff (parameters override, patches
                      appended or replaced). A finalized pick resolves to the
                      raw render it came from. Semantic summary is required.
                      → human rates on chimera →
finalize_generation   the pick, delivered: one ComfyUI graph that redraws at
                      2048, cuts a matte and composites the backdrop and purple
                      stroke; recorded as a refinement batch of the source.
repair_generation     optional: a masked local redraw of hands / feet.
get_request           status of any of the above; list_requests for the queue.
```

`create_request` is the raw form of all three (kind + payload) for anything
the dedicated tools do not cover. A round is not closed until the pick has
been finalized: generation 0 is the pre-delivery SaveImage output, and the
delivery identity is what finalize adds on top of it. The birefnet matte is
stored as a `mask` GenerationAsset of the raw redraw, so a cutout can be
redone from the record without another 2048 pass.

Discord notification is the worker's job — every ingest and every finalize
posts to the webhook. There is no separate watcher daemon. The webhook is a
credential and lives in `.local/discord-webhook` on the box; never put it in a
tracked file.

## chimera 連携の不変条件

- 生成の記録は chimera（https://chimera.chanu.co）。実行経路は chimera の
  requests 行を worker（GPU 機の `comfy-recipes work`）が実行する一本のみ。
  Mac 側の入口は MCP（`derive_request` / `finalize_generation` /
  `repair_generation` / `create_request`）か `POST /api/v1/requests`。
  semantic 判断（prompt 組み立て、reference の意味付け、検品）は呼び出し元
  エージェントの仕事で、chimera と worker は実行と記録だけを担う。
- ComfyUI `/prompt` への直 POST は禁止。レシピが組めない graph は
  `create_request` の payload に `generation.graph` として入れて渡す（seed と
  SaveImage prefix は job ごとに worker が差し替える）。投稿した graph JSON は
  job に保存され、chimera のレコード単体で再投稿・再現できることがこの規則の
  目的。コードの置き場（`.local/` 含む）は provenance に関与しない。
- graph モードは生 `.replace` の抜け道ではない。`build()` の返り値の prompt に
  `.replace` を当ててから `generation.graph` に載せるのは、Edit レコードが
  終わらせたはずの黙って外れる splice の再導入 — departure は pose 側の Edit
  レコードか request の `patches` にする。
- `generation.graph` 使用時、`generation.parameters` はビルドに使われず記録
  専用になる。graph に実在しない値を書くと chimera の記録だけが嘘になるので、
  graph に実際に入れた値だけを書く。
- 派生は `derive_request` で作る。親の recipe / parameters / patches を
  引き継ぎ、差分だけを渡す（派生は派生元の prompt + α、失敗の上に重ねず good へ戻る）。finalize 済みを親に
  渡すと raw まで自動で遡る。`.local/` に request 組み立てスクリプトを書く
  のは、この tool で表せない場合だけ。
- chimera への記録は生成の完了条件。画像だけでなく semantics（各 arm の狙い、
  base からの差分、何を検証する render か）も起票時に書く — `derive_request`
  の `semantic.summary` は必須で、ingest 直後に各 generation へ自動 PUT
  される。作業途中の評価はユーザーが chimera の semantics を見て行う。
  semantics/tag は AI が書いてよい（rating だけが人間専用）。
- 納品した generation は `comfy-recipes metadata publish <generation_id>`
  （MCP なら `record_publication`）で記録し、`look:<pose>` タグを付ける。次の
  セッションが起点 ID を引く索引は `list_generations published=true` と
  この `look:<pose>` タグで、prose とメモリは索引にならない。`look:` の値は
  レシピの pose 名（焼き込み前なら焼き込む予定の名前）。
- 事後の追記・上書きは `comfy-recipes metadata semantic <generation_id>
  <file.json>`、tag は `comfy-recipes metadata tag <generation_id> <name>`、
  納品記録は `comfy-recipes metadata publish <generation_id> [--url URL]
  [--idempotency-key KEY]`（key 省略時は呼び出しごとに新しい key）。
  semantic の API は `PUT /api/v1/generations/{id}/semantic`（schema_version:1、
  部分ペイロード可、再 PUT で全置換）。generation_id には short_id も使える。
- idempotency_key は呼び出し元が作る。同じ key の再送は同じ行を返す
  （`created: false`）。失敗した request を「もう一度」なら新しい key を使う。
  worker 側の `<request>.state.json` は worker の再開用で、Mac には無い。
- chimera への全リクエストに User-Agent の明示が必須（urllib のデフォルトは
  Cloudflare が 403/1010 で弾く）。MCP 経由は気にしなくてよい。
- rating（bad/neutral/good）を書くのは人間だけ。エージェントは人間の rating と
  semantic を `get_generation` / `list_batch` で読んで改善を進める。AI が
  画像を開く検品は、rating と semantic だけでは判断できない場合の最終手段
  （トークン消費が理由）。
- Service Token は 1Password `chimera-claude-agent`。取得後は untracked の
  `.local/chimera-token`（0600）にキャッシュされ、以後 Touch ID なしで動く。
  値をトラックされるファイルに書かない。
- request JSON のトップレベル `experiment` ブロック（`experiment_id` /
  `run_id` / `overrides.patches`）は chimera の ExperimentRun 由来の上書きを
  運ぶ経路。`overrides.patches` は `generation.patches` と同じ語彙・同じ
  `validate_request` の検証を通り、`generation.patches` /
  `generation.graph` / `generation.prompt`（`negative_prompt` も同様）とは
  併用できない — 二つの入口で適用順序が曖昧になるため。上書きの正本は
  chimera 側の ExperimentRun であり、worker は取り込んで既存の patch 機構に
  流すだけ。バッチ作成後、worker は `PATCH /api/v1/experiment-runs/{run_id}`
  に `batch_id` のみを送る。generation_id は代表選定が人間/エージェントの
  仕事なので worker は推測しない。

## The costume is a contract, not a preference

The shared blocks — `CHARACTER`, `LEGWEAR`, `BODY`, `FACE`, `SURFACE`, in the
Yukari domain's `costumes.py` and `prompt_style.py` — are worn by **every pose
at once**, and the delivery identity (backdrop `#c7e5e9`, the purple stroke,
the acceptance band, in `delivery_style.py`) is worn by every
delivered picture. Editing either changes every render this repo has ever
approved, which is why `scripts/costume_check.py` hashes both and fails on
any change it was not told about:

```bash
uv run scripts/costume_check.py            # fingerprints + per-pose declarations
uv run scripts/costume_check.py --accept   # the new hashes, for a change that is meant
```

When it fails, nothing is broken — something was changed. Paste the new
fingerprint, and write in `docs/render-notes.md` what the look is now.

Two rules that follow from this, both learned the expensive way:

- **A settled design decision that lives only in prose is a decision the next
  session does not get.** The one-garment leg was agreed, written into the notes
  and into memory, and applied by throwaway scripts in `.local/` — while
  `LEGWEAR` still built the retired two-layer costume, so another session got
  tights under knee-highs straight out of the recipe. If a change is settled,
  put it in the blocks.
- **A pass that redraws the face without `positive()` must carry the eye
  identity by hand.** The recipe path holds the eye design because FACE always
  rides along; a rough→finish img2img or eye-region inpaint runs on a
  hand-written prompt, and at high denoise hassaku's own detailed eyes walk in
  (28bgoa). Put `FACE` in that pass's positive and `EYE_BAN`
  (`prompt_style.py`) in its negative — both, not either.
- **Splices are string replacements and fail silently.** That failure is why
  per-pose departures are `Edit` records now: `replace`/`remove` assert their
  needle is present, and `_splice`'s `when=` gate is how a costume says "no
  such garment" out loud. If you write a bare `.replace` against a block
  anyway, you are reintroducing the bug class the records exist to end.

## Working files

`.local/` is untracked (`.gitignore`) and is where analysis scripts, sweeps and
logs go — `uv run .local/foo.py`. It is not the repo: anything worth keeping
moves into `scripts/` or `docs/render-notes.md`. Request JSON no longer lives
here: a round is queued with `derive_request`, and the record on chimera is the
reproducible artefact.

`docs/render-notes.md` is the record of what was measured, including what was
measured and came back *null*. Append to it; do not tidy it. Findings that
contradict an earlier entry get a correction written next to them, not a
deletion — several entries exist only to stop something being retried.

## No crops while the prompt is being tuned

**Do not crop, cut out or repair a render to deliver it.** If a picture needs a
crop to be acceptable, the prompt has not solved the problem, and the next arm
gets judged against an image the recipe cannot produce.

This was learned on `stand`: a two-figure render had a good left half, and
cutting it would have shipped a pose that never draws one figure. What actually
fixed it was the canvas -- 768 wide leaves no room beside her -- and that was
only reached because the crop was off the table.

Post-processing that sets a value the prompt cannot hold is a different thing
and is still fine: `recolor_bg.py` exists because the backdrop is unstable under
any perturbation. Removing part of the picture is not that.

## Reading images

Rendered images are expensive in context. **Do not open renders to browse them.**
Queue, let the worker ingest, and let the user rate on chimera — they name the
short_id of the one they want, and that is when you look (`get_generation_image`
returns a reduced JPEG; the full PNG is `/g/<short_id>/image`). Measure with
numpy instead where a number will do, and keep in mind that four of this repo's
image statistics have already disagreed with the user's eye and lost.
