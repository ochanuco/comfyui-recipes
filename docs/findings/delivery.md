# Delivery: deliver, palette, matte, stroke

The delivery identity (solid backdrop `#ffffff`, purple stroke, acceptance band)
lives in `domain/yukari/delivery_style.py`, fingerprinted by
`scripts/delivery_check.py`. When `--accept` records a change, rewrite
"The look now" below. Tags and `a<n> §` pointers: see
[`docs/README.md`](../README.md).

## The look now

- Deliver delivers the raw Anima pick: matte, repin, backdrop and purple
  stroke, no redraw. An IL redraw (`redraw` method `canvas`: hassaku-il-v22
  at 2560, d0.4) is opt-in per request and is delivered afterwards.
  Defaults: `DELIVER_DEFAULTS` in `delivery_style.py`. `[Anima]`
- Deliver defaults: repin on, backdrop `dots`, stroke light from `n`. The
  diagonal stripes + faint focus lines backdrop is `backdrop=stripes`. `[Anima]`
- The bands are a list (`OUTLINES`, the `outlines` deliver option), innermost
  first: a white band at 0.8% of the longest side, then the `#885b80` rim at
  1.04%, each polygonised (Douglas–Peucker, eps 0.5%) for a hand-cut look.
  0.8 was picked over 0.2 and 0.4 on a raw drawn without a white outline
  (5e5p2h against fjci20 / ocym2i). The innermost band also runs under the
  figure's own edge pixels, so a soft edge blends into the band, not the
  backdrop. The prompt no longer draws `(white outline:1.3)`: ViTMatte keeps
  a drawn outline as figure, so it only stacked on the computed band. `[Anima]`
- Light-direction shading on the outermost band, 8 directions; the drop
  shadow falls straight away from the light in that band's shape, the same
  way it is extruded. `stroke_light` `even` is a uniform band; no bands
  (`outlines: []`) is no rim and no shadow. `[all]` (a6 §Hand-cut sticker rim)
- Matte: RMBG BiRefNet-general, retraced (`soft_clamped` + `shadow_cut` +
  `enclosed_cut`), then ViTMatte (`YukariMatting`) on a ±12 px trimap of it,
  in 512 px tiles; foreground colour by pymatting's estimate, despilled on
  the soft edge only. The ViTMatte alpha is the saved `alpha` asset. Every
  pose renders on green (grey sat too close to the pale skin at the edge).
  Green in small pockets between fingers is left by both the old cut and
  ViTMatte. The 1 px key alpha and `drawn_outline` remain only for graphs
  recorded before the matting stage. `[Anima]`
- Depth of field is its own request (`dof`) on a delivered picture's layers:
  each layer blurred on its own and composited back to front, so an
  out-of-focus figure spreads a soft alpha over the rim and backdrop instead
  of fading it into paper white. `[Anima]`
- Detail density follows the redraw canvas: draw at 2560, shrink to 1536. `[IL]`

## Holds

- Cut the delivery silhouette with a matte model on the raw, pre-correction
  image, never from colour: repin can cut into pale hair. `[all]` (a5 §納品のシルエット)
- A computed stroke replaces model-drawn outlines: two concentric model rims
  do not survive seeds, and a band has no tag vocabulary. `[all]` (a5 §縁の出し方比較; a4 §A second marker outline)
- `white outline` in the prompt also bought a flat background; without it,
  background flatness fell to 3 of 6 seeds, so a flatness screen is required.
  `[IL]` (a5 §追試)
- Straight-alpha layers (backdrop, purple, white, figure) let rim width and
  colour change without re-running the repaint. `[all]` (a5 §レイヤー分離)
- Crop first, then stroke: a stroke drawn before a crop has no rim at the cut.
  `[all]` (a5 §2026-08-28 部屋着のピンク)
- The transparent compose route composites the bands first and cuts the backdrop after;
  the colour test is bounded by the compose's own band geometry or it holes
  pale hair. `[all]` (a6 §`cut_backdrop`)
- Stroke width is a share of the canvas's longest side; a median band
  estimate from the figure is "not found" past ~50% contour without outline.
  `[all]` (a4 §肩紐; a4 §The purple stroke's automatic width)
- Backdrop recolour fringe: shift pixels by their backdrop share inside a 1 px
  feather; tolerance cannot separate fringe from skin. `[all]` (a4 §「じゃぎってる」; a4 §「輪郭の雰囲気)
- The enclosed-pocket repaint cannot tell a gap from a pale detail inside the
  figure; per-render tolerance, not a new default. `[all]` (a4 §`deliver.py --enclosed-tolerance`)
- Seat layered delivery: backdrop → seat → frame → figure, re-running
  `clean_background` with the seat pasted into the backdrop. `[Anima]`

## Palette (repin)

- Repin per hue window, not one saturation scale; a light-band normalisation
  computes the factor per render. Fixed per-pose factors did not generalise
  (×0.30 vs ×0.55). `[all]` (a5 §2026-08-28 パレットを明示化; a5 §repin 採用)
- Every accent family needs its own window: pink in the purple window (170–225)
  goes lavender; cyan inner hair has 115–140, exempt from the dark-band grey.
  `[all]` (a5 §部屋着のピンク; a6 §repin's cyan)
- A correction built to subtract damages an in-band render (crushed irises,
  pink blotches); skip it, do not shrink it. `[all]` (a5 §補正は)
- Hue interpolation goes the short way round, or purple → skin crosses green at
  every feather. Skin restoration fires only where skin was painted. `[all]` (a5 §肌ピン自体)
- Despill on a yellow-green key pinks the skin at the excess-24 edge; limit it
  to the edge band. It projects onto the key's chroma instead of capping green,
  because `(green background)` draws a teal and a green cap left a cyan rim.
  `[Anima]`
- Matte model: `BiRefNet-general` kept the enclosed gaps under the chin in 3
  fragments; RMBG `BiRefNet-HR` filled them as figure and `HR-matting` split
  the edge into 35. `[Anima]`
- `recolor` is for the lap palette; a sketch delivery uses repin or nothing. `[all]`

## Redraw passes (IL opt-in)

- A redraw is not a magnification: it adds saturation bumps and fringing to a
  flat style. Lanczos keeps an approved look. `[all]` (a5 §hige の印刷経路)
- The route decides the surface, denoise the invention: image-space Lanczos at
  0.45 beats latent bicubic at 0.60. Latent upscale leaves banding in flats.
  `[all]` (a2 §Refining a chair render; a2 §Image-space upscaling)
- A refine only thins the line; do not add one the first pass does not need.
  `[all]` (a2 §`prone`)
- Apply corrections in one pass from the last approved render; stacked passes
  drift the palette. `[all]` (a2 §Corrections go on in one pass)
- Rough look needs both halves: drop the finish tags and ban clean-line tags.
  Hand-drawn line on IL came from removing the style block and texture bans.
  `[IL]` (a5 §2026-08-29 ラフ化; a6 §On IL the style block)
- Pass-2 gloss regression: ban `detailed shading, heavy shading, impasto,
  painterly` in the pass-2 negative only. `[IL]` (a4 §「線画の絵柄)

## Does not work

- Post-process that removes part of the picture to make it acceptable. `[all]`
- Handdrawn tag on the redraw; d0.55 plain is the loose hand-drawn dial. `[IL]`
- A greyscale init for colourising a rough: no colour comes out. `[all]` (a5 §ラフに色を乗せる)
- See-through part decomposition off-front: drops legs and legwear, and its
  output is a redraw. `[all]` (a5 §See-through)
- Chaining two same-size image-space passes to rough then colour. `[IL]` (a5 §2026-08-29 再考)
