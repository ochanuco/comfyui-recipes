# The GPU box

ComfyUI and the worker run on the Windows GPU box; the Mac only edits recipes
and reads chimera. The box's address and ssh alias are in the untracked
`CLAUDE.local.md`. Deploys and restarts are in [release.md](release.md).

## Setting it up

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ochanuco/comfyui-recipes.git
uv venv --python <uv-managed 3.12 python.exe> .venv
uv pip install --python .venv\Scripts\python.exe -e . pillow numpy opencv-python scipy websockets pytest
$env:PYTHONPATH = "scripts"; .\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe -q
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\worker\register-nodes.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\worker\register-comfyui.ps1 -PortableRoot <dir>
```

`register-nodes.ps1` junctions `comfy_nodes/yukari_finalize` and
`comfy_nodes/yukari_worker` into ComfyUI's `custom_nodes/`.
`register-comfyui.ps1` registers the portable ComfyUI as the logon task
`comfyui` with the launch arguments the script holds and
`COMFYUI_RECIPES_WORKER=1`, so the worker runs as a thread inside ComfyUI
and a reboot brings both back once the user logs on. Changing an argument
means editing the script and re-running it; `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` is not
used. `register-watch.ps1` / `watch.ps1` still register a standalone
`comfy-recipes work` loop for running it by hand; the deploy does not use
them. `.local/chimera-token` and `.local/discord-webhook` are copied onto
the box by hand; they are never tracked. The box must stay on a checkout
whose branch matches the `recipe_ref` of the rows it should serve (see
[queueing.md](queueing.md#worker)).

Two things that only show up over `ssh comfyui-worker`:

- Reparse points do not resolve in that session. The WinGet `uv.exe` link
  fails with "no application is associated", and uv's
  `cpython-3.12-windows-x86_64-none` alias is a junction that fails with
  "untrusted mount point". Call the package's own `uv.exe` and point
  `uv venv` at the versioned `cpython-3.12.<patch>-...` directory instead.
- The locale encoding is cp932. Text I/O in this repo passes
  `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly, and the wrapper sets `PYTHONUTF8=1` for
  the CLI's stdout.

## Content rating

Every image the worker uploads to chimera is also rated by the WD tagger
(`wd-swinv2-tagger-v3`, ONNX on CPU) and the raw rating and general-tag
probabilities are PUT to `/api/v1/generations/{id}/safety`. Thresholds and
badges are chimera's. A failure -- no `onnxruntime`, no network for the first
download, chimera not yet serving the endpoint -- is only logged and never
fails the job. The model downloads on first use into
`.local/_nogit/models/wd-tagger` (override with `COMFY_RECIPES_MODEL_DIR`),
sha256-checked against the pinned revision. `comfy-recipes safety rate <short_id>...`
and `comfy-recipes safety backfill [--published] [--limit N]` rate existing
generations.

## Getting models onto it

They have to be on that machine's disk, and nothing in the ComfyUI HTTP API can
put them there. `/experiment/models` is read-only, there is no download
endpoint, and no standard node fetches a URL. Short of ComfyUI-Manager, that
leaves running a command over there.

[models.md](models.md) is the inventory to work from, with the Hugging Face
repo or Civitai version each model came from and its SHA256. `scripts/fetch-models-windows.ps1` automates that pull for a
Windows portable install, but only for hassaku-il-v22 and two LoRAs, so anything
else still needs a command by hand.

For a checkpoint mirrored to Hugging Face in diffusers layout:

```powershell
# on the Windows machine, from the portable install root
.\python_embeded\python.exe -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('John6666/hassaku-xl-illustrious-v22-sdxl', local_dir=r'.\ComfyUI\models\diffusers\hassaku-il-v22')"
```

The `hf` CLI is a trap on a portable install. It imports `venv` on startup,
which the embedded Python does not ship, so it dies before downloading
anything; `snapshot_download` never touches that import.

`DiffusersLoader` lists a directory the moment its `model_index.json` lands,
which is long before the 5GB `unet/` does. A model showing up in
`/object_info/DiffusersLoader` is therefore not a signal that it can be loaded.
Loading a half-fetched folder fails with `'NoneType' object has no attribute
'lower'`, which is ComfyUI reporting a missing file badly.

### A download must outlive the ssh session

A process started over `ssh comfyui-worker` — `Start-Process` included — dies
the moment the session closes, and a `hf_hub_download` or `curl` that was
half-way through a 6GB file just stops without an error (measured three
times: 20s, 45s and 60s of session gave 1GB, 2.7GB and 4.7GB). Register the
fetch as a scheduled task and run it from there instead:

```powershell
schtasks /Create /TN fetch_ckpts /TR "powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\...\fetch_ckpts.ps1" /SC ONCE /ST 00:00 /F
schtasks /Run /TN fetch_ckpts
```

The script itself is a `curl.exe -L -C - --retry 5 --retry-all-errors` loop
per file into `<name>.part`, renamed on exit 0; `.local/ab2/fetch_ckpts.ps1`
is the one that fetched the 2026-09-05 checkpoints. Civitai's
`/api/download/models/<version>` worked anonymously for the Nova models; a
`CIVITAI_TOKEN` is only needed for gated ones. Watch the `.part` size from
here, not the log line — the log only moves when a file finishes.

## Checking whether the far end is up

Windows blocks ICMP by default, so `ping` fails against a machine that is up and
serving. Check the port, or ask `/system_stats`:

```bash
curl -s http://$COMFYUI_HOST:8188/system_stats
```

`/object_info` is also the honest answer to "does it have the models" — an empty
`CheckpointLoaderSimple` list means an empty `models/checkpoints`, whatever the
disk looks like from over here.

## Generation timings

Every claimed request ends with a `PUT /api/v1/requests/<id>/timings`
(version `v2`, source `worker`) after the final status PATCH, for `done` and
`failed` attempts. A failure to send is logged and never changes the
outcome. A worker killed mid-request sends nothing, and `released` is not
sent. Timestamps are epoch milliseconds on the box clock.

What one attempt records:

- `claimed_at` when the claim response returned, `finished_at` when the
  final PATCH returned.
- Per prompt: `submitted_at`, `outputs_ready_at` (the poll that saw the
  finished history entry) and `ingested_at` (outputs registered in chimera;
  null for the pose-detect prompt). `execution_start_at`, `execution_end_at`,
  the cached node ids and `status` come from the history entry's
  `status.messages`. A prompt picked up again after a restart is
  `resumed: true` with no `submitted_at`. `purpose` is `render`, or
  `pose_detect` for repair's DWPose pass.
- Per node: `started_at` at the `executing` event for it, `ended_at` at the
  next `executing`, `steps_total` and `step_ms` (gaps between consecutive
  `progress` events, the first measured from the node's start) from ComfyUI's
  `/ws` broadcast. Cached nodes carry no times. `cold_load` is true when a
  loader node (UNET, CLIP, VAE, checkpoint, LoRA, ControlNet, diffusers)
  ran uncached in any prompt.
- `env`: ComfyUI and PyTorch versions, launch `argv` and the `attention`
  derived from it, worker commit and dirtiness, GPU name and driver
  (`nvidia-smi`). Read once, and again after the `/ws` feed drops or while
  ComfyUI was unreachable.

The `/ws` feed runs whenever the worker runs, hub or not. It connects with
`?clientId=<id>` and every `POST /prompt` carries the same `client_id` (one
random id per worker process), because ComfyUI sends the `executing` family
only to the submitting client. `progress_state` node transitions set a node's
start and, with precedence, its end. Only `progress` events are relayed to the
hub. Binary preview frames are ignored.

### Role names

Every submitted graph is copied and each node without a `_meta.title`
gets one, so a role is the same across graph revisions:

| Node | Role |
| --- | --- |
| sampler fed from `EmptyLatentImage` | `base_sampler` |
| sampler fed through a latent upscale | `hires_sampler` |
| sampler fed from a `VAEEncode` | `redraw_sampler` |
| a further sampler on the same chain | `<group>_sampler_stage2`, `_stage3` |
| `LatentUpscale` / `LatentUpscaleBy` | `hires_upscale` |
| `CLIPTextEncode` on a sampler's `positive` / `negative` | `positive_prompt` / `negative_prompt` |
| `VAEDecode` feeding a save | `vae_decode` |
| loaders | `unet_loader`, `clip_loader`, `vae_loader`, `checkpoint_loader`, `lora_loader`, `controlnet_loader`, `diffusers_loader` |
| `SaveImage` | `save_image` |
| anything else | snake_case class name |

A name used by more than one node gets `_2`, `_3` in topological order.
