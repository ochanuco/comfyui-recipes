"""Yukari's delivery policy: what happens to a render after the model.

The prompt cannot hold these values (the backdrop is not prompt-stable, the
purple marker is a post-process), so the delivery tools apply them instead
and every tool reads its default from here -- one source for what a
delivered picture wears. `delivery_check.py` fingerprints this file, so a
change here changes every future delivery.

Calibration measurements behind each number are in
