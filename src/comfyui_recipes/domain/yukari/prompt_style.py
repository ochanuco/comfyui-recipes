"""Yukari's fixed prompt blocks and render constants.

Every block that is concatenated mid-prompt ends with its own ", " -- the
assembly in `recipe.py` only ever joins strings end to end, never inserts a
separator of its own. `STYLE` is the exception: it is always the tail of the
positive prompt, so it carries no trailing comma.
